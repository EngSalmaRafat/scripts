7.1.2014 / LL 


Tried to run the normalization script I using R-3.0.2 ("bin/R3"):
source("normalisation_011_part_I.R")

This halts at ODBC part that I commented in the code.

I never got in here:
source("normalisation_011_part_II.R")

Conclusion/suggestion: despite numerous attempts, I have not been able to implement normalization on Linux machine. 
- Keep import/normalization part on the Windows machine, or harmonize it with HITChip procedures.
- Move all profiling functionality to Linux computer (and delete them from Windows) to avoid confusion!
- This will require regular import of the SQL databases on the Linux computer. Leo can handle this part.
