1. login

mysql -u root -p

2. Create a new user and password with the following command:

CREATE USER 'pit' IDENTIFIED BY 'passu';

3. Assign privileges to the new user, enter the command:

GRANT ALL ON *.* TO 'pit';

4. Create Phyloarray database. I also needed to remove old version with the drop command before installation succeeds!

mysql -u pit -p
drop database `pitchipdb`;
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS Phyloarray_PIT;

5. Exit MySQL interface, enter:

exit

6. Load the dump into the database. Note: "pitchipdb" database name was already defined in SQL dump (phyloarray_pit2nd_20120323_0844.sql) and trying to change it here caused failures in R package

mysql -upit -ppassu pitchipdb < /home/lei/data/PITChip/phyloarray_pit2nd_20120323_0844.sql

7. Test R package

library(microbiome)
params <- run.profiling.script(dbuser = "pit", dbpwd = "passu", dbname = "pitchipdb")
